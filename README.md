BikeShare provides analytic information on local bike use that empowers commuters to ditch their cars. Users can access weather, past trip, and station data as well as an e-commerce platform to purchase bike accessories. This app aspires to increase the amount of bike traffic while reducing the number of cars on the road.

BikeShare includes user login/logout authentication supported by the bcrypt gem, which gives the user access to cart checkout, their account information, and analytics dashboards for easy trip planning. Admin authorization provides access to create, edit, and remove bike stations, bike store items, and trip or weather records. 

Tools used:
* Ruby on Rails
* Active Record
* Postgresql database
